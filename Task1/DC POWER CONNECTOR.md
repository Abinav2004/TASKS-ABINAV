DC power connectors, also called DC plugs or barrel connectors, are a common interface for delivering direct current power to small devices and equipment. This plug and socket type connector comes in a diverse array of shapes, sizes, and configurations and is typically used to power electrical devices or deliver power within low-voltage systems, such as subsystems within a vehicle. Common examples of DC connectors include barrel connectors, coaxial power connectors, audio connectors, power jacks, and USB connectors. The jack typically receives power and is mounted in the appliance, either on a PCB or in the chassis. the plug is most often located on the electrical cord and supplies power from the power supply. A Receptacle is also mounted on a power cord and receives power from a mating plug.
