 Oscillators are essential components that produce a periodic electronic signal, typically a sine wave or square wave. Oscillators convert DC signal to periodic AC signals which can be used to set frequency, be used for audio applications, or used as a clock signal. Electronic devices use the clock signal as a reference for time, allowing actions to be performed consistently. Other devices use the oscillator’s signal to generate other frequencies which can generate radio signals(The oscillating current pushes the electrons in the antenna back and forth, creating oscillating electric and magnetic fields, which radiate the energy away from the antenna as radio waves. The radio waves carry the information to the receiver location.).

Most widely used types Types:
- Ceramic Resonators
- Quartz Oscillators

**Ceramic Oscillators:**
Piezoelectric ceramic material with two or more metal electrodes forms the basis of a ceramic resonator. In an electronic circuit, the piezoelectric element resonates mechanically, which generates an oscillating signal of a specific frequency - like a tuning fork.

**Quartz Oscillators:**
When the crystal is shock excited by either a physical compression or, in our case, an applied voltage, it will vibrate mechanically at a specific frequency. This vibration will continue for some time, generating an ac voltage between its terminals. For most devices that will take an external crystal clock source, this will be integrated into the device, and the only additional electronic components required are the load capacitors. The load capacitors are essential; if the capacitance of these is incorrect, the oscillator will not be stable. The crystal oscillator circuit sustains oscillation by taking a voltage signal from the quartz resonator, amplifying it, and feeding it back to the resonator

**RC OSCILLATORS:**
RC oscillators are a type of feedback oscillator; they consist of an amplifying device, a transistor  with some of its output energy fed back into its input through a network of resistors and capacitors, an RC network, to achieve positive feedback, causing it to generate an oscillating sinusoidal voltage
