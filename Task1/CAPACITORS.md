Capacitors are considered as one of the Big Three Passive Components, along with resistors and inductors. Passive components are electronic devices that consume, store, and/or release electricity.

A capacitor typically consists of an insulator with two metal plates attached on both sides of the insulator. Insulators do not conduct current. The insulator used in capacitors is called a dielectric. solid dielectric are used to make sure that the metal don't come in contact and also high dielectric materials are better than air. The positive and negative charges are transferred within the conductor during the flow of electricity. Unlike the battery, a capacitor is a circuit component that temporarily stores electrical energy through distributing charged particles on (generally two) plates to create a potential difference. A capacitor can take a shorter time than a battery to charge up and it can release all the energy very quickly.

It is really important that the capacitor used has a larger voltage rating than that of the cell and that it is connected with the right polarity (the negative plate should be connected to the negative terminal of the cell) otherwise it could potentially explode. capacitors like electrolytic and tantalum are polarized. as soon as you put reverse voltage or over positive voltage the capacitor blows up, like a diode

The charges flow through the capacitor when it is supplied with electricity, but this flow is blocked by the insulator between the metal plates. Consequently, the charges are accumulated in one of the two metal plates, while the other plate is induced with an opposing charge.
Therefore, the structure of the capacitors allows for electricity to be stored between the two metal plates. The materials used for the insulator include gases, oils, ceramics, and resin

1. **DC Charging**: When a DC voltage is applied across a capacitor, it charges to the same voltage as the source, and then the current stops flowing.
2. **AC Charging**: With an AC voltage, the voltage continuously varies, causing charges to move back and forth in the capacitor. This phenomenon creates an illusion of current flow through the capacitor, even though the charges themselves don't pass through it.
3. **Black Box Analogy**: Viewing the capacitor as a black box, it appears as if electric current enters one side and exits the other, only to return in the next cycle. This observation leads to the misconception that an AC current is passing through the capacitor.
4. **Actual Charge Movement**: Despite the appearance of current flow, the charges don't physically pass through the capacitor. Instead, they accumulate on the capacitor's plates, storing energy in the electric field between them.

Functions:
 1) Charging and discharging
 2) Maintaining the voltage at the same level
 3) Removing noise(connected parallel to the output) (coupling and decoupling):While decoupling capacitors are connected in parallel to the signal path and are used to filter out the AC component, coupling capacitors, on the other hand, are connected in series to the signal path and are used to filter out the DC component of a signal. They are used in both analog and digital circuit applications.
**SMD CAPACITORS:**
1) Multilayer Ceramic Capacitor/Chip capacitor:
   ![[Pasted image 20240426223912.png|300]]
   The thickness of a single dielectric and the number of stacked layers are directly proportional to the capacitance of the MLCC. The multi-layered construction allows them to achieve high capacitance values while still maintaining a small physical size, making them ideal for applications where space is limited. MLCCs have capacitance values ranging from 100 pF to 100 µF. Another important property of MLCCs is their low equivalent series resistance (ESR). ESR is a measure of the internal resistance of a capacitor, and a lower ESR indicates that the capacitor can discharge more quickly and efficiently. This is particularly important in high-frequency applications, where rapid discharge times are required. MLCCs are used in timing circuits, where they are used to stabilize the frequency of oscillators and provide accurate timing signals. They are also used in RF filters. It is characterized by its small size and heat resistance.
2) Tantalum Capacitor:

   Tantalum capacitors are used widely to give high levels of capacitance compared with ceramic capacitors. Tantalum capacitors are made with capacitance values ranging from 1nF all the way to 72mF.The voltage rating for tantalum capacitors varies from 2V to more than 500V.Tantalum electrolytic capacitors are exceptionally polarized devices. While aluminum electrolytic capacitors, which are polarized as well, might survive a briefly applied reverse voltage, tantalum capacitors are very sensitive to reverse polarization. If a reverse polarity voltage is applied, the dielectric oxide breaks down, sometimes forming a short circuit. This short circuit may later cause thermal runaway and destruction of the capacitor.
3) aluminum Electrolytic Capacitor:
   This capacitor is made of aluminum and another metal. An oxide film is used as a dielectric material since it blocks electricity by forming on the surface of the aluminum. This type of capacitor presents high capacitance at an affordable price. Therefore, it has been widely employed as a high-capacitance capacitor. They are larger sized as compared to others.
