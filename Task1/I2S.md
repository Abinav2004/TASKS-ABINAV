I2S is a synchronous, serial communication protocol for exchanging digital audio data between sound-processing devices such as microcontrollers, audio codecs, or digital signal processors. It uses a shared clock signal to synchronize the data transmission between devices and transmits audio in a serial fashion. The protocol is often used in designs that require high-quality audio transmission.

On the physical level, the protocol requires three connections between the devices on a bus: the clock signal (SCK) for synchronizing communication partners, a word select (WS) line for switching between the left and right audio channels, and a dedicated data wire exclusively for transmitting audio information bit-by-bit.

In I2S  the clock signal continuously runs, and the bits representing the audio data are also placed continuously on the single data line. The transmission does not occur in frames of fixed sizes. Rather, the active transmitter sends any data available for transmission, while the receiver reads as many bits as possible — or as expected to be received. The only limitation is that the sender must transmit the data with the MSB first. Apart from this, the recipients and senders do not require agreement on fixed message lengths. Anything a receiver can’t process will be lost, hence why sending the MSB first is the sole requirement.
The sender can additionally clock out data bits on either the falling or rising edge of the SCK signal, but the receivers must read the data on the signal’s rising edge. Finally, there are no unused clock transitions. Each transition represents the transfer of one bit, regardless of whether or not there’s data on the bus. As a result, the MSB of the next word immediately follows the LSB of the last word without any padding or delays.
