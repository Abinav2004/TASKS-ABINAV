**USB(Universal Serial Bus):**
A universal serial bus is intended to allow hot swapping & enhance plug-N- play. The plug-and-play allows the OS to configure and discover a new peripheral device spontaneously without starting the computer whereas hot swapping  describes **the act of removing components from or plugging them into a computer system while the power remains switched on**. This means that parts can be changed without shutting down or rebooting a computer or server.
The processor continuously checks whether the input/output device is prepared for transmitting data or not. Thus, the I/O devices do not have to update the processor regarding their conditions because it is the main responsibility of the processor to check continuously. Once the host becomes responsive to the new device then it knows the device capacities by reading the available data within the particular memory of the USB interface of the device. So that the host uses a suitable driver to communicate with devices. After that, the host allocates an address to the new device which is written to the device register. In USB protocol, master devices are known as USB hosts which start all the communication that happens above the USB bus.


Port-This is what the USB cable is plugging into
Type-This is the shape of the USB connector or port
Version-This is the technology that allows data to be transferred along the cable
 two elements of USB standard to consider-the physical connector shape and the underlying protocol (speed).

**USB TYPE-A:**
Compatible with: USB 1.1 Type A, USB 2.0 Type A and USB 3.0.

USB Type A connectors have **backward capability**
Backward compatibility refers to the ability of a system, software, or device to work with older versions or previous iterations. It means that new versions are designed to be compatible with older versions, ensuring that they can still communicate and function together seamlessly.

**USB TYPE-B:**
Compatible with: USB 1,1 Type B, USB 2.0 Type B, USB 3.0 Type B

**USB TYPE-C:**
Compatible with: USB 3.0

Type C connectors differ in appearance compared to the previous USB types, as they are symmetrical and have a small and thin appearance. One major difference is that the USB C is reversible; meaning it does not matter which way the connector is facing.
