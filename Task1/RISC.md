- RISC stands for **Reduced Instruction Set Computer Processor**, a instruction set architecture with a simple collection and highly customized set of instructions.
- It means each instruction cycle requires only one clock cycle, and each cycle contains three parameters: fetch, decode and execute
- The RISC processor is also used to perform various complex instructions by combining them into simpler ones.
**Advantages:**
-  RISC processor is simpler than a CISC processor because of its simple and quick design, and it can complete its work in one clock cycle.
- The RISC processor's performance is better due to the simple and limited number of the instruction set

Some important features of RISC processors are:
1. **One cycle execution time:** For executing each instruction in a computer, the RISC processors require one CPI (Clock per cycle). And each CPI includes the fetch, decode and execute method applied in computer instruction.
2. **Pipelining technique:** The pipelining technique is used in the RISC processors to execute multiple parts or stages of instructions to perform more efficiently.
3. **A large number of registers:** RISC processors are optimized with multiple registers that can be used to store instruction and quickly respond to the computer and minimize interaction with computer memory.
4. It supports a simple addressing mode and fixed length of instruction for executing the pipeline.
5. It uses LOAD and STORE instruction to access the memory location. Separate load and store instructions transfers data between the register bank and external memory load/store architecture, the addressing mode for every operand is fixed. Load instructions read data from memory and copy it to a register. Store instructions write data from a register to memory.
6. Simple and limited instruction reduces the execution time of a process in a RISC.
**NOTE:** RISC V is an architecture but RISC is an instruction set.
